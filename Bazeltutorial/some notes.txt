bazel does not work with directories and files that have spaces in their names

WORKSPACE file is present in the root of the repo and is used to PULL external dependancies. no need to add them manully. BIG ADVANTAGE
BUILD file stores the instructions
use run command to run something. it will build files in baze-bin and also run them directly
format is

bazel run directory/directory:namegiven inside the BUILD folder

bazel run examples/example3:example3

this builds the executables in the bazel-bin directory
from there can run without bazel as its now built

 bazel-bin/examples/example3/example3.exe
